<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Pressure Type</li><li>Constant Volume Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial ventilation market features primarily two types: constant pressure and constant volume systems. Constant pressure systems maintain a stable airway pressure, ensuring consistent airflow regardless of changes in lung compliance or resistance. This is crucial for patients requiring precise ventilation support. In contrast, constant volume systems deliver a predetermined volume of air with each breath, providing consistent ventilation regardless of airway resistance variations. Both types cater to specific clinical needs, enhancing patient outcomes in respiratory care.</p></p>
