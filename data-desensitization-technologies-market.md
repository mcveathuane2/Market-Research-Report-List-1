<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Desensitization Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Masking</li><li>Static Masking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Data desensitization technologies are crucial for protecting sensitive information by altering its visibility while maintaining its usability for legitimate purposes. There are two main types: dynamic masking and static masking. Dynamic masking temporarily obfuscates data in real-time during access, ensuring that users see only what they are authorized to view, which is ideal for live environments. In contrast, static masking creates a permanently altered version of data, useful for development and testing environments, where sensitive data is not needed.</p></p>
