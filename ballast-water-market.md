<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ballast Water Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Method</li><li>Physical Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ballast water treatment market comprises two primary methods: chemical and physical. Chemical methods involve the use of biocides to eliminate harmful organisms in ballast water, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. These treatments effectively target a wide range of pathogens but may pose environmental risks due to residual chemicals. In contrast, physical methods employ non-chemical techniques such as filtration, UV radiation, or heat treatment to treat ballast water, minimizing ecological impact while maintaining efficiency in organism removal. Both methods aim to protect marine ecosystems.</p></p>
