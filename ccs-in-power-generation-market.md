<p><strong>The CCS in Power Generation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Combustion Capture</li><li>Post-Combustion Capture</li><li>Oxy-Fuel Combustion Capture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CCS, or Carbon Capture and Storage, plays a crucial role in power generation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Pre-combustion capture involves removing CO2 before fuel is burned, enhancing efficiency. Post-combustion capture occurs after combustion, capturing CO2 from exhaust gases. Oxy-fuel combustion capture uses pure oxygen for combustion, resulting in a more concentrated CO2 stream, making capture easier. Together, these technologies enable cleaner energy production, helping mitigate climate change while maintaining energy supply reliability.</p></p>
