<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Electric Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal electric power generation market comprises three main types: dry steam stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle stations. Dry steam stations utilize steam directly extracted from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines. Flash steam power stations take high-pressure hot water, allowing it to "flash" into steam as pressure decreases, driving turbines. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, vaporizing it to drive turbines, making them more versatile and environmentally friendly.</p></p>
